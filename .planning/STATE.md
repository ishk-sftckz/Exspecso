# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-26)

**Core value:** Approved specs must survive context limits, implementation, failure, verification, runtime changes, and session boundaries without losing intent or allowing unproven work to count as complete.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Initialize Canonical Projects

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Initialize Canonical Projects) — phase incomplete
Plan: 9 of 10 active; Plan 01-08 complete
Status: Blocked pending 01-09 native-provider/platform approval
Last activity: 2026-08-27 — 01-08 completed after the user explicitly approved its Task 1 tracer; stale-owner coverage, 62 automated tests, and build passed.

Plan execution: [████████░░] 80% (8/10 plans); phase completion remains blocked by verification gaps and pending human/security gates.

### Plan 01-08 Completion

- Completed Tasks: Task 1 RED `1c8a38e`, GREEN `8a3b0f5`; Task 2 RED `b47b7df`, `32ad719`, GREEN `4c55690`.
- Approval: the user explicitly replied `approve` to the 01-08 Task 1 tracer explanation. That approval was consumed only to expand into Task 2; it does not approve 01-09.
- Evidence: focused ownership matrix (7 tests), required recovery/minimal/validation suite (25 tests), full suite (8 files, 62 tests), and `npm run build` passed.
- Summary: `.planning/phases/01-initialize-canonical-projects/01-08-SUMMARY.md`.
- The old tracer checkpoint is cleared. Do not start 01-09 without its separate native-provider/build/install/platform approval.

### Recent Completed Plan

- Plan: `01-07`; Task 1 tracer approval was explicitly provided before Task 2 began.
- RED commits: `6c08599`, `649107d`. GREEN commits: `dcb1aae`, `5ebd1c2`.
- Final verification: `npm test -- --run` passed (54 tests); `npm run build` passed.
- Full independent phase re-verification, native-provider approval, real-TTY UAT, prohibition acknowledgements, and security audit remain pending.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Project]: Use Documentation v13's Phase-oriented workflow as the implementation source of truth.
- [Project]: Keep one canonical `.exspecso/roadmap.md` with stable ID `ROADMAP`; it owns the lightweight Phase and Spec declaration/dependency map.
- [Project]: Use `exspecso-<operation>` as the portable skill ID and `/exspecso-<operation>` as public notation; adapters translate only host-owned sigils.
- [Project]: `/exspecso-start` always creates the lightweight Phase/Spec Roadmap map without materializing detailed Phase or Spec artifacts.
- [Project]: `/exspecso-plan PHASE-NNN` deeply plans every Spec in one Phase while preserving independent Spec contracts.
- [Project]: `/exspecso-implement PHASE-NNN` runs one outer Phase Delivery Loop with one active internal Spec Delivery Loop at a time by default.
- [Project]: Follow a contract-led vertical MVP spine.
- [Phase 2]: Prove deterministic artifact resolution, validation, context selection, readiness, status, Phase/Spec selection, and next-action reconstruction against hand-authored fixtures before Phase 3 orientation work begins.
- [Phase ?]: Use an opaque UUID plus repository-derived editable title for the minimal project configuration.
- [Phase ?]: Treat a .git directory or worktree marker file as the nearest containing Git-root boundary.
- [Phase ?]: Explicit submitted agents, never detected environments, control persisted configuration and adapter writes.
- [Phase ?]: Adapter plans are immutable pure values built only from the submitted selection and preserve its order.
- [Phase ?]: D-20 is a closed public stable-ID registry; alternate prefixes remain invalid instead of compatibility aliases.
- [Phase ?]: Malformed or ambiguous canonical state aggregates diagnostics and blocks init before staging or mutation.
- [Phase ?]: Adapter ownership is proven only by each generated file's versioned header and matching SHA-256 body hash.
- [Phase ?]: Rerun configuration is additive, while only explicitly requested adapters can be created, refreshed, or replaced.
- [Phase ?]: Replacement is selected-target scoped and every planned preimage is rechecked before promotion.
- [Phase 01]: Restore only the hash-validated prior set after an interrupted init transaction; ambiguity preserves evidence and blocks new writes.
- [Phase ?]: Use own-property declaration checks so explicit invalid id and parent values cannot disappear during artifact scanning.
- [Phase ?]: Keep config JSON parsing under configuration diagnostics while malformed non-config canonical JSON emits EXSPECSO_ARTIFACT_PARSE.
- [Phase ?]: Use scanner diagnostics as the single declaration-validation path to aggregate each independent canonical error once.
- [Phase ?]: Recovery, standalone transactions, and runInit share one token-bound lease; only the outer owner releases it.
- [Phase ?]: Only a sole complete UUID-matched dead ownership record is reclaimable; legacy, partial, unreadable, changed, or unexpected evidence remains diagnostic.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CR-01 invalid canonical JSON declarations are repaired by Plan 01-07; independent phase re-verification remains required before closing the recorded verifier gap.
- The live-writer recovery and stale-owner races are repaired and tested in 01-08; CR-02 still requires independent phase re-verification before it is closed.
- Pathname-based promotion can follow a post-validation symlink swap outside the repository (ART-07); evidence is a reproduced copy primitive plus reachable code path, not a full CLI race.
- Plans 01-08 through 01-10 remain in serial waves. Plan 01-09 requires explicit native-provider/build/install/platform approval before native changes; approval has not been granted.
- Next: `$gsd-execute-phase 1 --gaps-only`, then independent re-verification, real-TTY UAT, prohibition acknowledgement, and `$gsd-secure-phase 1` before advancement.
- Reports: `01-REVIEW.md` and `01-VERIFICATION.md` in `.planning/phases/01-initialize-canonical-projects/`.
