# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-26)

**Core value:** Approved specs must survive context limits, implementation, failure, verification, runtime changes, and session boundaries without losing intent or allowing unproven work to count as complete.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Initialize Canonical Projects

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Initialize Canonical Projects) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 6
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-27 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Project]: Use Documentation v13's Phase-oriented workflow as the implementation source of truth.
- [Project]: Keep one canonical `.exspecso/roadmap.md` with stable ID `ROADMAP`; it owns the lightweight Phase and Spec declaration/dependency map.
- [Project]: Use `exspecso-<operation>` as the portable skill ID and `/exspecso-<operation>` as public notation; adapters translate only host-owned sigils.
- [Project]: `/exspecso-start` always creates the lightweight Phase/Spec Roadmap map without materializing detailed Phase or Spec artifacts.
- [Project]: `/exspecso-plan PHASE-NNN` deeply plans every Spec in one Phase while preserving independent Spec contracts.
- [Project]: `/exspecso-implement PHASE-NNN` runs one outer Phase Delivery Loop with one active internal Spec Delivery Loop at a time by default.
- [Project]: Follow a contract-led vertical MVP spine.
- [Phase 2]: Prove deterministic artifact resolution, validation, context selection, readiness, status, Phase/Spec selection, and next-action reconstruction against hand-authored fixtures before Phase 3 orientation work begins.
- [Phase ?]: Use an opaque UUID plus repository-derived editable title for the minimal project configuration.
- [Phase ?]: Treat a .git directory or worktree marker file as the nearest containing Git-root boundary.
- [Phase ?]: Explicit submitted agents, never detected environments, control persisted configuration and adapter writes.
- [Phase ?]: Adapter plans are immutable pure values built only from the submitted selection and preserve its order.
